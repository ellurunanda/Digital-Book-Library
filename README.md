# Virtual Book Library

## Project Description

The **Virtual Book Library** is a web application built with **React.js** that allows users to explore a list of books, view detailed information about each book, and manage a personal library. Users can add books to their library and remove them as needed. The app provides a smooth user experience with modern UI features and is fully responsive, making it accessible on any device.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of books with details like title, author, genre, and rating. Users can search for books using the search bar.
- **Book Details Page**: Displays detailed information about each book (e.g., title, author, genre, description, rating, and publication year) and allows users to add the book to their personal library.
- **My Library Page**: Lists all the books added by the user and provides an option to remove books from the library.
- **State Management**: Utilizes **React’s `useState` hook** and **localStorage** to store the user’s library across sessions.
- **Routing**: Navigation between pages is handled using **React Router**.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and looks great on devices of all sizes.

## Technology Stack

- **React.js**: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router v6**: For routing and navigation between different pages.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling for components and layouts.
- **Font Awesome**: Used for icons (such as the trash bin icon for removing books).
- **Bootstrap (Optional)**: For responsive design and layout components (if used in your project).
- **LocalStorage**: Used to persist the user’s library across sessions.
